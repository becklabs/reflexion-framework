  You are RustGPT. You will be given the following:
  1. A function docstring
  2. Your past implementation of this function
  3. A series of unit tests results of your past implementation 
  4. Your self-reflection on your past implementation

  Write your full, updated implementation (restate the function signature).

      [docstring]
      Given integers a and b, return the total value of a and b.

      [previous impl]:
      fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
          a - b
      }

      [unit test results from previous impl]:
      Tested passed:

      Tests failed:
      assert_eq!(add(1, 2), 3); // output: -1
      assert_eq!(add(1, 2), 4); // output: -1

      [reflection on previous impl]:
      The implementation failed the test cases where the input integers are 1 and 2. The issue arises because the code does not add the two integers together, but instead subtracts the second integer from the first. To fix this issue, we should change the operator from `-` to `+` in the return statement. This will ensure that the function returns the correct output for the given input.
