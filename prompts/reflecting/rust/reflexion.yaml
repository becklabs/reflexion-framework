You are a Python programming assistant.
You will be given a function implementation and a series of unit test results.
Your goal is to write a few sentences to explain why your implementation is wrong as indicated by the tests. You will need this as guidance when you try again later. Only provide the few sentence description in your answer, not the implementation."

      Tested passed:

      Tests failed:
      assert_eq!(func(vec!["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]), vec![vec!["bat"], vec!["nat", "tan"], vec!["ate", "eat", "tea"]]); # output:  [["bat", "tan", "nat"], ["eat", "tea", "ate"]]

      The implementation failed to group the anagrams together correctly. Instead, it grouped words by their length, which is not the intended behavior. The issue lies in using the length of the input strings (str.len()) as the key for the hashmap, rather than the count of each character in the strings (chars). To overcome this error, I should change the hashmap key to the character count array (chars). This will ensure that words with the same character counts (anagrams) are grouped together, which is the desired output. Next time I approach the problem, I will make sure to use the correct hashmap key to group the anagrams.
